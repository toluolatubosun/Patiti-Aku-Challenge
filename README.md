## The problem

## My Solution
Every user has a consent property where the consents can be updated based on the events

Each event has a userId and a timestamp. This makes it very easy to determine the consent of a user.

I am making use of indexes on the user model so they can't have duplicate permissions

The user has implemented basic crud routes

And the events model has only get and create routes

This is a very simple solution.
